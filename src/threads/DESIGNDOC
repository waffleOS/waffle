---- LOGISTICS ----

These questions will help us to keep track of the difficulty level of
assignments, as well as keeping track of which team members worked on
which parts.

>> L1: How many hours did each team member spend on this assignment?
   Make sure that each member's total time is listed.
   Rahul: 10 hours
   Robert: 7 hours
   David: 28 hours

>> L2: What did each team member focus on for this assignment?  Keep
   descriptions to 25-30 words or less.

   Rahul: Implemented advanced priority donation.
   Robert: Attempted to implement priority donation but failed at it.
   David: Implemented alarm, basic priority scheduler, and advanced 
          scheduler. Debugged various list API errors.
   
			     ALARM CLOCK
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

Added static struct list sleep_list (timer.c)
    To track which threads are sleeping and need to be woken up. 

Modified struct thread (thread.h)
    Added struct list_elem sleepelem to put threads in the sleep_list.
    Added int wait_time to track when the thread needed to be woken up.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.
    First, the wake time for the thread is determined in units of ticks. Next,
    interrupts are disabled to prevent other threads from preempting the
    current thread while it is trying to sleep. The thread is put in a sleep
    list that contains all threads that are sleeping, and interrupts are
    disabled. Finally, the thread is actually yielded by context switching in
    thread_sleep(), which blocks the thread and schedules a new thread to be
    run.
    
>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?
    Only the necessary computations are done. This includes determining
    the thread(s) to wake, and updating the advanced scheduler if the 
    mlfqs flag is set.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?
    Race conditions are prevented since timer_sleep disables interrupts when
    putting the current thread to sleep. Other threads cannot preempt a thread
    that is trying to sleep.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?
    This does not occur as we turn off timer interrupts in timer_sleep.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?
    This design guarantees that the critical code in timer_sleep is not
    preempted, thereby avoiding race conditions. While this does slow the rate
    of timer interrupts, the amount of code run during timer_sleep is small
    enough to prevent the system from feeling sluggish.

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

In thread.h:
struct thread {
    struct list lock_list; /*!< List of locks owned by this thread. */
    struct list all_locks_list; /*!< List of locks. */
    struct lock * lock_waiting; /* The lock this current thread is waiting on */
};

In synch.h:
struct lock {
    int donated_priority;   /* The priority which was donated to this lock.
                            Will be the priority of the highest thread which
                            wants this lock. */
    struct list_elem elem;  /* Need this to put the struct lock into lists. */
};

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?
    The scheduler always schedules the thread with the highest priority. When
    a thread with donated priority releases a lock, then the thread with the
    highest priority is able to acquire the lock since it is scheduled next.

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?
    When lock_acquire cases a priority donation, a recursive function
    lock_donate_priority is called that donates a given priority to the lock
    and then recursively calls itself to donate priority if the lock's owner is
    waiting on another lock. This handles nested donations by donating priority
    to all threads that are waiting on locks in order to run the thread holding
    the first lock.
>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.
    When lock_release is called on a lock that a higher-priority thread is
    waiting for, the lock's priority is set to the minimum priority. This
    resets the thread's priority back to its original priority before it was
    donated a higher priority. Then the highest priority thread is run and
    acquires the lock.

			  ADVANCED SCHEDULER
			  ==================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

Added typedef int fixed_F 
    To represent Q(31 - F).F fixed point arithmetic.
    This is part of the fixed point API defined in fixed-point.h/.c

Added static fixed_F load_avg
    To keep track of the load_avg for the system.

Modified struct thread (thread.h)
    Added int nice to track the niceness of each thread.
    Added fixed_F recent_cpu to track the recent CPU of each thread.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C3: Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values
>> in the table uncertain?  If so, what rule did you use to resolve
>> them?  Does this match the behavior of your scheduler?
    The above calculations were done starting with load_avg = 0. Ambiguities
    include the order of computations. The computations above, and in the
    scheduler implementation first update the current thread's recent cpu,
    then update the load_avg, recent_cpu for all threads, and finally
    update the priorities.

>> C4: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code
>> inside and outside interrupt context likely to affect performance?
    Most of the updates are time-sensitive, and are implemented in the
    interrupt context. This will reduce the responsiveness of interrupts
    because a lot of computation is being done with every timer interrupt.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C5: Briefly critique your design, pointing out advantages and
>> disadvantages in your design choices.  If you were to have extra
>> time to work on this part of the project, how might you choose to
>> refine or improve your design?
    Advantages include simple implementation to understand, and a
    good fixed point abstraction layer to allow for easy changes.
    Disadvantages include slower computations due to the overhead
    of calling functions. From an efficiency standpoint, work could
    be done to optimize the fixed point arithmetic, so the time
    spent in interrupt handlers is minimized.

    We defined a fixed_F type, which is an integer that represents
    a Q(31 - F).F fixed point value. The API implemented includes 
    functions to construct fixed_F values from integer and rational
    representations, as well as for performing multiplication and
    division between fixed_F values, and converting back into 
    an integer (rounding to the nearest integer). This gives a
    layer of abstraction, and allows parameters such as F, the
    number of binary fractional digits, to be adjusted easily.
