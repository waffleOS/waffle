	# This is the wrapper that bridges the gap from the BIOS bootstrap to
	# our C program's entry-point.  It has two main responsibilities.
	# The first is to get our program off of the disk and into memory.
	# The second is to get from 16-bit real mode into 32-bit protected
	# mode.
	#=====================================================================

	# We need to output 16-bit x86 machine code at this point,
	# since the processor starts out in 16-bit real mode.

	# BOOTLOADER STARTS HERE
	#
	# This part of the code is responsible for loading the main program
	# off of the disk image and into memory at some available address.
	# We choose 0x00020000 (2000:0000 or equivalent), just because.  This
	# would give us hundreds of KB of memory to use, but we won't use
	# even a fraction of that space.
	#
	# At this point, %dl will be the drive number of the boot device
	# (i.e. the disk that the bootloader # was loaded off of).
	# This allows us to load additional data from the boot disk.
