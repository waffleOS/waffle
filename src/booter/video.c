/* This is the address of the VGA text-mode video buffer.  Note that this
 * buffer actually holds 8 pages of text, but only the first page (page 0)
 * will be displayed.
 *
 * Individual characters in text-mode VGA are represented as two adjacent
 * bytes:
 *     Byte 0 = the character value
 *     Byte 1 = the color of the character:  the high nibble is the background
 *              color, and the low nibble is the foreground color
 *
 * See http://wiki.osdev.org/Printing_to_Screen for more details.
 *
 * Also, if you decide to use a graphical video mode, the active video buffer
 * may reside at another address, and the data will definitely be in another
 * format.  It's a complicated topic.  If you are really intent on learning
 * more about this topic, go to http://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page and look at
 * the VGA links in the "Video" section.
